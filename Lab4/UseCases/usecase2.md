# Use Case 2

<hr>

**Use Case**: Color test

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: To test if pressing on each key will show the corresponding color as described.

**Preconditions**: The program must be running and in a responsive state.

**Trigger**: (1) Pressing the 1 key. (2) Pressing the 2 key. (3) Pressing the 3 key. (4) Pressing the 4 key. (5) Pressing the 5 key. (6) Pressing the 6 key. (7) Pressing the 7 key. (8) Pressing the 8 key. 
  
**Scenario 1**: A user will press the 1 key when they want to draw in black.

**Scenario 2**: A user will press the 2 key when they want to draw in white.
 
**Scenario 3**: A user will press the 3 key when they want to draw in red.
 
**Scenario 4**: A user will press the 4 key when they want to draw in green.
 
**Scenario 5**: A user will press the 5 key when they want to draw in blue.
 
**Scenario 6**: A user will press the 6 key when they want to draw in yellow.
 
**Scenario 7**: A user will press the 7 key when they want to draw in magenta.
 
**Scenario 8**: A user will press the 8 key when they want to draw in cyan.
 
**Exceptions**: The program may become potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated from the operating system. When a user presses on a key, the program might draw a color that is different from the documentation. In this case, further examination is required.

**Priority**: High-priority.

**When available**: First release

**Channel to actor**: The primary actor communicates through the keyboard. The system should respond within 1 second of any keyboard event. The user is responsible for all other input.

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: We may need to add more key-color relationship in the future, and revise this use case to prompt a user testing other colors before exiting.
