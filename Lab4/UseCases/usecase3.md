# Use Case 3

<hr>

**Use Case**: The window size and drawable canvas size

**Primary Actor**: Machine

**Goal in Context**: To terminate if the size of the window and that of the drawable canvas are both 600 x 400.

**Preconditions**: The program must be running and in a responsive state.

**Trigger**: Start the program.
  
**Scenario**: A user will start the program and draw.
 
**Exceptions**: The size might be different than 600 x 400. In this case, the program can be terminated from the operating system and some codes needed to be edited.

**Priority**: High-priority.

**When available**: First release

**Channel to actor**: The primary actor communicates through programs in the software package. The system is responsible for maintaining the size of the window when the window is opened. 

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: We may need to enable the canvas to be either bigger or smaller based on different needs in the future, and revise this use case.
