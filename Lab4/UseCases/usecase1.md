# Use Case 1

<hr>

**Use Case**: Clear Canvas

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: To clear the entire canvas.

**Preconditions**: The program must be running and in a responsive state.

**Trigger**: Pressing the space key.
  
**Scenario**: A user will press the space key when they are not satisfied with their work.
 
**Exceptions**: The program may become potentially unresponsive. In this case, the program can be terminated from the operating system.

**Priority**: High-priority.

**When available**: First release

**Channel to actor**: The primary actor communicates through the keyboard. The system should respond within 1 second of any keyboard event. The user is responsible for all other input.

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: We might need to implement 'reverse' functionality in the future, since the user might press the space key by accident.
